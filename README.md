# GCC Class Schedule Visualizer

Our team created this web application as part of our Software Engineering course at Grove City College. The focus of the class project was to learn more about working as a team on software while using collaboration resources like Scrum, git, etc., and we were required to produce an application of some form that improved upon our college's class scheduling process. We decided to create a web application that used entirely front-end technologies, and we made use of common resources like jQuery, Bootstrap, and some calendar display frameworks.

## Issues

Our code could have benefited greatly from modularization and organization if we had used Angular, Typescript, and/or other front-end technologies, and if I had to work more on the project I would definitely transition over to those. But at the time most of our team was new to web development and had enough on their plate adjusting to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, so that wasn't practical.

Also, the main point of the project wasn't to have a perfect result but to get better at the actual process of team development, so there wasn't a huge point in going overkill on new technologies and frameworks.
